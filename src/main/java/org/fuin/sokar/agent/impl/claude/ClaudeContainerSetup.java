/**
 * What Claude Code needs in a fresh container before it will run.
 * <p>
 * The endpoint is not used: this agent is told where to send its requests with environment
 * variables, which is the shape it declared. An agent that can only be given a URL writes it into
 * a file here instead.
 * <p>
 * Two files with two different owners, which is why each is produced somewhere else:
 * {@link ClaudeFirstRun} is the agent's own state, {@link ClaudeSettings} is configuration a person
 * would otherwise edit. This class only says what a container needs.
 * <p>
 * <strong>No credential file.</strong> The task's token reaches the CLI in the variable the definition
 * names for its kind - {@code ANTHROPIC_API_KEY} or {@code CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN} - and that is what it
 * authenticates from. Measured on 2.1.267 at a terminal: with the variable removed, a
 * {@code .credentials.json} holding the same token gave no key and no token at all, for both kinds;
 * with the file removed, the variable alone authenticated. A file the CLI does not read is only a
 * second copy of the token.
