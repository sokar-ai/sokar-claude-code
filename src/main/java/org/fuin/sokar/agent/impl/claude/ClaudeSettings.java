/**
 * The settings that stop the CLI asking to be allowed to do what it was started to do.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Entering bypass mode raises a dialog, whichever way it is entered.</strong> The CLI opens
 * with a full-screen warning whose default answer is "No, exit" and which asks the operator to
 * accept responsibility for actions taken in bypass mode. It is not a permission prompt, so no flag
 * answers it - and unattended there is nobody to answer it at all, which is a task that starts and
 * then waits at a menu.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Each key does one thing, measured on 2.1.267 at a terminal, a fresh task per run:</strong>
 * {@code defaultMode} alone puts the session in bypass mode and raises the
 * warning, with or without {@code --dangerously-skip-permissions}; {@code
 * skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt} alone silences the warning but leaves manual mode unless the
 * flag is given; both together reach bypass mode with no warning, and the flag then changes
 * nothing, so it is not passed. Headless the same holds: without {@code defaultMode} a {@code -p} run
 * stopped to ask permission for a shell command, a question nobody answers there; with it the command
 * ran.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Answering it here is defensible in a way it would not be on a person's machine.</strong>
 * The responsibility the dialog asks about is the container's: an unreviewed egress policy, a
 * workspace that is a clone rather than the operator's checkout, and a gate between anything the
 * agent commits and the real upstream. The question was answered when somebody chose to run the
 * agent in a box.
 * <p>
 * <strong>It also keeps the CLI at the version that was installed.</strong> See
 * {@code doc/decisions.md}, "The CLI does not update itself in a task".
 * <p>
 * Kept apart from {@link ClaudeFirstRun}, which answers the wizard, because the two files are
 * different: this is configuration a person would edit, that is state the CLI writes itself.
